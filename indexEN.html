	<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

	<p>Bibinary is a game in which you must find the binary code of numbers. It's almost fun.</p>
	<p>There is several levels, from A1 to F6. To pass a level, you must find 3 codes. The letter indicates how much help you've got to find the code (cf. below). The number increases with the size of the code you must find.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="level1">A1</span>, <span class="level2">A2</span>, <span class="level3">A3</span>, <span class="level4">A4</span>, <span class="level5">A5</span>, <span class="level6">A6</span> : the number obtained with the current code is diplayed, decimal popups appear, you can swich 0|1 as much as you want.</li>
		<li><span class="level1">B1</span>, <span class="level2">B2</span>, <span class="level3">B3</span>, <span class="level4">B4</span>, <span class="level5">B5</span>, <span class="level6">B6</span> : the number obtained with the current code is no longer diplayed, decimal popups appear, you can swich 0|1 as much as you want.</li>
		<li><span class="level1">C1</span>, <span class="level2">C2</span>, <span class="level3">C3</span>, <span class="level4">C4</span>, <span class="level5">C5</span>, <span class="level6">C6</span> : the number obtained with the current code is no longer diplayed, decimal popups don't appear anymore, you can swich 0|1 as much as you want.</li>
		<li><span class="level1">D1</span>, <span class="level2">D2</span>, <span class="level3">D3</span>, <span class="level4">D4</span>, <span class="level5">D5</span>, <span class="level6">D6</span> : the number obtained with the current code is diplayed, decimal popups appear, if you flip a 0|1 that is not supposed to be flipped, you will have a penality of 10 seconds and a new number will appear.</li>
		<li><span class="level1">E1</span>, <span class="level2">E2</span>, <span class="level3">E3</span>, <span class="level4">E4</span>, <span class="level5">E5</span>, <span class="level6">E6</span> : the number obtained with the current code is no longer diplayed, decimal popups appear, if you flip a 0|1 that is not supposed to be flipped, you will have a penality of 10 seconds and a new number will appear.</li>
		<li><span class="level1">F1</span>, <span class="level2">F2</span>, <span class="level3">F3</span>, <span class="level4">F4</span>, <span class="level5">F5</span>, <span class="level6">F6</span> : the number obtained with the current code is no longer diplayed, decimal popups don't appear anymore, if you flip a 0|1 that is not supposed to be flipped, you will have a penality of 10 seconds and a new number will appear.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is two modes : the time mode and the infinite mode. In the time mode, you have a limited time (40s) to find as many binary codes as possible. You can start at the level you want (from the lowest level to the highest already reached level). In the infinite mode, you always start at the lowest level and you must go as far as possible. You win when you pass F6. In both modes, the highest reached level appears on the home page.</p>
